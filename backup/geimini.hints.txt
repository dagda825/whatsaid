ok, so at the end of this session, I've got the logic for creating a new .ini file if needed,
next is to read config.ini or, should it not be present, create one and place the default
configuration fields into it.

so the basics for the config.ini, I should call it whatsaid.ini, is:
(remember, the paths shown are for illustrative purposes only. in the initial
 install, they should be blank)

[paths]
base_folder = /home/jon/.local/whatsaid/
base_config_folder = /home/jon/.config/whatsaid/

[file format]
file_ext = '.csv'

Note that resolvePathStr only focuses on getting the config path, not the data path.
I need to update the function to resolve either config or data. I think it can be done
by passing the environment variable to the function, defaulting to the config file.

I'd like to try keeping the bookmarks.csv files in base_folder, so the TreeNodes structor will
look like the folders structure under base_folder.
